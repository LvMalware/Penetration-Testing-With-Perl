=head2 Penetration-Testing-With-Perl

This project is a collection of the programs in the book L<Penetration Testing With Perl|https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/penetration-testing-perl-raw> by Douglas Berdeaux

I'm adding the programs as I work through the book, refactoring as I go.

=head2 PRE-REQS

These programs require a number C libraries:

=over 2

=item * libpcap, libpcap-devel (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS package names)

=item * arpack, arpack-devel (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS package names)

=item * smbtree

Several of the Perl modules would not install because of test failures. I just
force installed them with C<cpanm>:

  $ cpanm -f Module::Name
